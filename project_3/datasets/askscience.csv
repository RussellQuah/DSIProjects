0,,askscience,"Hello everyone! We thought it was time for a meta post to connect with our community. We have two topics we'd like to cover today. Please grab a mug of tea and pull up a comfy chair so we can have a chat.

---

**COVID-19**

First, we wanted to talk about COVID-19. The mod team and all of our expert panelists have been working overtime to address as many of your questions as we possibly can. People are understandably scared, and we are grateful that you view us as a trusted source of information right now. We are doing everything we can to offer information that is timely and accurate. 

With that said, there are some limits to what we can do. There are a lot of unknowns surrounding this virus and the disease it causes. Our policy has always been to rely on peer-reviewed science wherever possible, and an emerging infectious disease obviously presents some major challenges. Many of the questions we receive have been excellent, but the answers to them simply aren't known at this time. As always, we will not speculate. 

We are also limiting the number of similar questions that appear on the subreddit. Our panelists are working hard to offer in-depth responses, so we are referring people to similar posts when applicable. 

To help, we have compiled a few /r/AskScience resources:

- [The COVID-19 FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/medicine/2019-ncov): This is part of our larger FAQ that has posts about a multitude of topics. We are doing our best to update this frequently.

- [COVID-19 megathread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ewwmem/have_a_question_about_the_2019_novel_coronavirus/) and [COVID-19 megathread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/etkdx1/coronavirus_megathread/): Lots of questions and answers in these threads.

- [New COVID-19 post flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27covid-19%27&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on): We've added a new flair category just for COVID-19. You can filter on this to view only posts related to this topic. We are currently re-categorizing past posts to add to this. 

- We will continue to bring you new megathreads and AMAs as we can.

Of course, all this comes with the caveat that this situation is changing rapidly. Your safety is of the utmost importance, and we'd like to remind you not to take medical advice from the internet. Rely on trusted sources like the WHO and CDC, check in with your local health department regularly, and please follow any advice you may receive from your own doctor.

---

**AskScience AMAs**

Second, we wanted to discuss our AMA series a bit. As you know, many schools have either cancelled classes or moved to online learning. This presents a unique set of challenges for students and teachers alike. Many of our expert panelists also teach, and they are working extremely hard to move their courses online very quickly.

We are putting out a call for increased AMAs, with the goal of giving as many students as possible the opportunity to interact directly with people who work in STEM fields. This goes for all disciplines, not just those related to COVID-19. We typically host scientists, but we have also had outstanding AMAs from science authors and journalists. 

As always, we plan only schedule one AMA per day, but we will be making an effort to host them more frequently. To aid in this process, we've [created a website for interested parties to use to contact us]( https://sites.google.com/view/askscienceamas/). 

We schedule AMAs well in advance, so don't hesitate to contact us now to set something up down the line. If you'd like to do an AMA with your research team, that's great, too (group AMAs are *awesome*).
If you're a student or science educator, please keep an eye on the calendar in the sidebar! As always, feel free to reach out to us via modmail with questions or comments.

To kick things off, we'd like to cordially invite to join us for an **AMA with author Richard Preston on March 17**. He is the author of a number of narrative nonfiction books, including *The Hot Zone*, *The Demon in the Freezer*, and *Crisis in the Red Zone*.

I'm also the inventor of SuperBetter, a game that has helped more than a million players tackle real-life health challenges such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury. SuperBetter's effectiveness in treating depression and concussion recovery has been validated in clinical trial and randomized controlled studies. It's currently used by professional athletes, children's hospitals, substance recovery clinics and campus health centers worldwide. Since 2018, the SuperBetter app has been evaluated independently in multiple peer-reviewed scientific articles as the most effective app currently in the app store for treating depression and anxiety, and chronic pain, and for having the best evidence-based design for health behavior change.

18,,askscience," Hey everyone,

I posted this over r/AskPhysics a few days ago but didn't get an answer so I'm trying here.

I  am trying to understand the current state of knowledge on the cosmic  microwave background (CMB). This is obviously a broad topic and since  I'm not a cosmologist I don't understand everything.

I found the difference between E- and B-modes discussed here, with results from the BICEP-2 experiments:

[https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\~cbischoff/cmb/](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~cbischoff/cmb/)

The  difference between the modes is explained as a difference in the  orientation of the polarization, relative to the wave vector k. In the  way it is depicted, the orientations don't make sense since the  polarization direction should always be orthogonal to the direction of  the propagation of the wave (E-mode components are said to be either **parallel** or perpendicular to k). There's obviously something that I don't grasp here, could someone make it clearer ?

Also,  the map at the top of the page is supposed to show B-modes only but it  seems to show a continuum of angular values, so both E- and B-modes as  explained below. Why is it not the case ?

What  is the fundamental difference between these modes, as E-mode waves are  said to be mosty impacted by anisotropies in the early universe, while  B-modes are mostly impacted by gravitational waves from inflation ?

43,,askscience,"Hello, I am a bit lost in learning about eyes and glasses.

First, I'm farsightness and astigmatism. My glasses prescription is:
Right Eye: +3.50 Sphere -  -0.75 Cylinder - 166 Axis
Left Eye:  +4.00 Sphere -  -1.50 Cylinder -  170 Axis

The plus sphere corrects farsightness only and cylinder/axis corrects astigmatism, right? 

Now, my visual acuity for both my eyes are around 20/70. For a distance of 1.30m between my 30 inches TV computer (1080p) and my eyes, I have difficulty reading characters less than 20-25 font size depending of the font and contrast. It is unfortunate especially when playing some games that involves a lot of dialogue or and text.
I have Usher Syndrome which includes Retinis Pigmentosa, I can see fine in my central vision and some parts of my peripheral vision. It is also why if I get closer to my screen, I will be able to read small characters but won't be able to see the whole screen because of my poor peripheral vision.

Now, my questions are:
Can you possibly have 20/20 while wearing farsightness/astigmatism glasses? 

I just noticed that I unconsciously strain my eyes almost all the times while wearing glasses and when I realized about it, I try to fully relax my eyes and noticed that the focus became 20% blur especially on the near. (Less bluer than when taking off glasses of course) It doesn't even give me headache or anything. Is this a bad sign, does that means, I must get a new prescription? From what I understand, glasses prevents eyes strain at all.

Could not wearing glasses that corrects farsightness (Just wearing glasses that corrects astigmatism) and try to not strain my eyes.(Seeing blur all the times) improve my visual acuity and making the focus less blur over time? (I considered about traveling without glasses, no near focus involved most of the time)

And finally, I'm wondering if retinis pigmentosa does also affect visual acuity.

I know that melting ice can lead to a cascading effect where more sunlight gets absorbed (the reverse for forming ice). Which process would be stronger, in this case?&lt;/p&gt;

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a question within these topics you weren&amp;#39;t sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt; post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday!

&lt;p&gt;I am especially interested in why the proton gradient upkeep will fail with increasing pH. I found some sources about Na-ATPases, that don´t use H+ that would just react with extracellular OH- forming water. But this is a work around. Is it the intracellular pH, that can only be buffered to a certain level until the protein synthesis fails?&lt;/p&gt;

The way I see it is that there is an input (observation) that yields an output (result of eigenvector decomposition of observation matrix). To me this seems like an energy intensive process, after all it is a change of state.

I am aware that no evidence has been found yet for a finite time of wave function collapse, and the commonly held belief is that the process is instantaneous. 

So my question is, how is this physically possible? 

Is it not more likely that the wave function collapse occurs over a finite timescale that is smaller than we have currently been able to measure?

If you were to mathematically describe the process to a computer, it would require processing time to reach the answer. Is the mathematical formulation of the problem the reason then for the processing time? 

What I mean to say is, eigenvector decomposition seems to be a energy intensive process. So how can the system do it instantaneously?

So I am wondering, positive current just means it is in the direction that positive charge would flow. Therefore it follows negative current would be in the direction that negative charge would flow. My question is, is the current negative because of the sign of the charge or because it flows in the opposite direction as positive? I know current is defined as dq/dt so it makes sense that dq would be negative with negative charges moving, but the charges could have had different names not involving arithmetic signs right? What is positive charge was red and negative charge was blue and we defined positive current as direction that red charge would move, then negative current couldn’t be a result of the sign of the charge but rather the direction, right?

228,,askscience,"I'm just a casual science enthusiast, so I'm not sure about any part of my understanding. Therefore, I'll first explain what I know so that you guys can correct me on whatever I got wrong.


So, if I understood correctly:


1) living things use both C¹² and C¹⁴. And since carbon is consistently absorbed (while alive), the rate between the two isotopes is constant-ish. Once the living thing, well, dies, there is no more absorbtion of carbon. From that point on, the rate of C¹² to C¹⁴ increases because of the radioactive decay of C¹⁴. And that's (more or less) how we get carbon dating, right?


2) Ok, so, C¹⁴ comes from cosmic rays interacting with the Nitrogen in the atmosphere, right? 




And now the questions:


a) if we changed the ratio of Nitrogen to Carbon in the atmosphere, like from a big enough eruption or something else, wouldn't that change the amount of C¹⁴ produced, and thus absorbed by life?


b) if we changed the amount of radiation received from the sun, like a period of more intensive solar activity or a thicker/thinner ozone layer, wouldn't that also change the amount of C¹⁴ produced?


and finally, *c) wouldn't events like these change the ratio of C¹⁴ on living things through history, thus making carbon dating too imprecise?*

Therefore, I&amp;#39;ll first explain what I know so that you guys can correct me on whatever I got wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if I understood correctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) living things use both C¹² and C¹⁴. And since carbon is consistently absorbed (while alive), the rate between the two isotopes is constant-ish. Once the living thing, well, dies, there is no more absorbtion of carbon. From that point on, the rate of C¹² to C¹⁴ increases because of the radioactive decay of C¹⁴. And that&amp;#39;s (more or less) how we get carbon dating, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Ok, so, C¹⁴ comes from cosmic rays interacting with the Nitrogen in the atmosphere, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) if we changed the ratio of Nitrogen to Carbon in the atmosphere, like from a big enough eruption or something else, wouldn&amp;#39;t that change the amount of C¹⁴ produced, and thus absorbed by life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) if we changed the amount of radiation received from the sun, like a period of more intensive solar activity or a thicker/thinner ozone layer, wouldn&amp;#39;t that also change the amount of C¹⁴ produced?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and finally, &lt;em&gt;c) wouldn&amp;#39;t events like these change the ratio of C¹⁴ on living things through history, thus making carbon dating too imprecise?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know carbon dating can never be the ONLY data for learning something&amp;#39;s age, and that a lot of OTHER data must be collected and compared... But I mean, I asking all this because it feels like the values/ratios would vary TOO much to be worth collecting.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi Reddit! I'm Keith Schneider, a professor in the Food Science and Human Nutrition Department in the Institute for Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. With concerns raised over the spread of COVID-19, consumers are worried about how to handling their grocery store purchases. Right now, [UF / IFAS](https://ifas.ufl.edu/covid19-information-updates/) is working to educate consumers and growers alike on the facts that are tied to taking care of produce during a global pandemic.

[Proof!](http://explore.research.ufl.edu/covid-19-response-your-grocery-and-food-safety-questions-answered.html)

More about me:

I received my PhD in Food Science and Human Nutrition, from the University of Florida, my Masters in Public Health from the University of South Florida and a Bachelors in Biology from the University of Florida. I have been working with Extension offices in Florida to help educate growers for over 20 years. Since 2005, I have reviewed various journals on produce safety, food science, microbiology,
nutrition and quality.

I'll be on at 1 pm ET (17 UT), AMA!

In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed.

Gravity on the other hand, as I understand it, isn't something that's emitted like some kind of tractor beam, it's a deformation in the fabric of the universe caused by a massive object. So, what I'm wondering is, is there a limit to the range at which this deformation has an effect. Does a big thing like a black hole not only have stronger gravity in general but also have the effects of it's gravity be felt further out than a small thing like my cat? Or does every massive object in the universe have some gravitational influence on every other object, if very neglegable, even if it's a great distance away? And if so, does that gravity move at some kind of speed, and how would it change if say two black holes merged into a bigger one? Additional mass isn't being created in such an event, but is ""new gravity"" being generated somehow that would then spread out from the merged object?

PNP have opposite directions, meaning either NPN or PNP have the collector as the one sending current, and if current is electrons, and electrons are negative, then one of those are negative (emitter for the first picture)

they do seem to consider holes as current as well, so I suppose it can flow either way depending on the charge we apply.

Do NPN transistors send current through the collector for the emitter to receive, electrons going collector-&gt;base-&gt;emitter, or is it the opposite?

edit: wait so the arrow shows the opposite direction or where electrons flow? Why? If so, it's PNP types where the collector is negative?

&lt;p&gt;edit 3: found &lt;a href=""https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/141720/what-do-the-arrows-in-transistor-symbols-point-to-and-from""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;The arrows in the bipolar transistors (emitter) show the direction of flow of conventional current. That is, current flow from positive to negative. Diode and LED symbols are the same.&amp;quot;, so it IS pointing at current direction, but only positive towards negative, considering we can send holes instead of electrons. I now just need confirmation this is it, and maybe how electricity from home plugs, who I suppose send electrons, end up being used for NPN or PNP.&lt;/p&gt;

337,,askscience,"A little while ago I came across [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk) video on youtube describing somthing called ""dopamine detox"". If you don't want to watch it yourself the basic idea is that by performing highly exciting/rewarding activities (such as video games, netflix, junk food etc.) too often our bodies become desensitized to our natural reward chemical and thus we require higher doses to feel good. A side effect of this is that *not* indulging in such activities gives us lower dopamine levels than we're used to and thus make it more difficult to focus on less immediately and intensely rewarding activities such as studying, exercising or practicing a musical instrument. 

Now to my personal anecdotal evidence. Even before watching this video I had been thinking a lot about my psychological health. More specifically, I believe I ""feel less"" than I used to. Or rather, it's as if my emotions are dampened. For example, I remember a few years ago when I was 15-16, reading/watching romantic scenes in books and tv series (especially ""unexpected first kiss"" scenes and similar) would give me these increadible emotional highs. It would feel like an adrenaline explosion in my chest. The first time it happened I remember vividly, and I rode that high for *days*. Nowadays I'm lucky if a get a small tingle of emotion. It also happens that I have played *a lot* of computer games since. We're talking thousands of hours. 

I considered if I was depressed for a while, since I've read that depression can cause similar symptoms, however I haven't displayed any other depression symptoms like agression or anti-social behavior.

Ohm’s law and power lines

Hi!
I’m getting a bit confused regarding ohm’s law and power=U * I ,especially when it comes to high voltage power lines .
I know that increasing the voltage and maintaining the power decreases the current, and by decreasing the current the power dissipated is lower.
But...
If the resistance of the conductor on the power lines remains constant, according to ohm’s law higher voltage means higher current.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the size of the herd have any bearing on what percentage must be achieved to maintain immunity? For example, would a herd of 100 individuals need a lower percentage than a herd of 100 million?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

424,,askscience,"I've recently been confronted with the physical branch of optics for the first time and found it quite fascinating. I wanted to dive deeper into how it works on an atomic level but got stuck in a condundrum and havent been able to think my way out.

From school, I know that the electrons of an atom only exist on discrete energy levels. A photon incident on an atom can raise the energy level of an electron if the Energy (E=hf) of the photon is precisely equal to a jump between the electrons discrete possible energy levels. I will explain my understandings of transmission and reflection based on this knowledge and then try to explain what my question is

&amp;#x200B;

Transmission occurs when incident light does not have the correct wavelength to carry the right amount of energy required to excite electrons in the material. Therefore, it does not interact with the material and passes through.

&amp;#x200B;

Reflection I'm not sure I understand very well, since I have read conflicting things. Some people have mentioned that an incoming photon is absorbed, and the electron then immediately drops down to its previous energy level, re-emitting the photon (effectively reflecting it). However I think my understanding here is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Absorption occurs when the wavelength of incoming light is such that its energy is exactly the same as that needed for a jump between energy levels by the electron.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to get to the actual question:

Assume I have an object that is not (or barely) transmissive in the visible spectrum and reflects red wavelengths (e.g 630-650 nm). This could for example be a red Lego brick.

So the object reflects visible red light and is not transmissive for visible light, which means that all other incident visible wavelengths must be absorbed by the object, since they aren't coming out of the back and therefore arent being transmitted, and they aren't being reflected to us since the object appears only red. However, based on my knowledge about absorption, it is not possible for all visible wavelengths other than red to be absorbed, because in order for a wave to be absorbed, its energy has to equal that of an electron jump. This is not the case for every wavelength between 380 -780 nm, as can easily be seen when calculating the energy of some random waves from this range. Therefore, what happens to these other incident waves?? If they are neither absorbed, transmitted nor reflected, do they impact the object and impart kinetic energy? does the object receive thermal energy from them? What happens?

Perhaps I have mistakes in my whole approach to this, if I do then please point them out.

473,,askscience,"Dear redditors,

I have a question regarding the peak analysis of experimental signals. For example in photoelectron spectroscopy you measure spectra with a background signal and more intense peak. Typically the background is quite noisy, while the peak looks smooth. For each bin E to E+Delta E there is the count rate c(E). Interpreting each bin as an count experiment the standard deviation is s(E)=sqrt(c(E)).

If I apply a fit which takes into account the statistical uncertainty for each measuered bin, the noisy background has a much higher weight, because sqrt(c(E)) is smaller for the background than for the peak. Just from my feeling this is weird. And sometimes I see that fits are worse compared to those neglecting the statistical uncertainty.

&lt;p&gt;I have a question regarding the peak analysis of experimental signals. For example in photoelectron spectroscopy you measure spectra with a background signal and more intense peak. Typically the background is quite noisy, while the peak looks smooth. For each bin E to E+Delta E there is the count rate c(E). Interpreting each bin as an count experiment the standard deviation is s(E)=sqrt(c(E)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I apply a fit which takes into account the statistical uncertainty for each measuered bin, the noisy background has a much higher weight, because sqrt(c(E)) is smaller for the background than for the peak. Just from my feeling this is weird. And sometimes I see that fits are worse compared to those neglecting the statistical uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this procedure wrong? How can I do better? A reference to literature would also help me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for suggestions and stay at home and stay healthy&lt;/p&gt;

475,,askscience,"I know the quick answer is ""it removes the sulfation from the plates"" but I was hoping for a little more in-depth answer.

Quick background: I have a 48V golf cart. The battery bank consists of six 8V batteries wired in series. I parked it shortly after Thanksgiving but forgot to plug it in. Fast forward to early March and the batteries are kaput, barely showing 1V in each  battery. I tried getting a quick surface charge on them but was unable to get any battery over 6V. Replacing all the batteries would cost over $700...ew. I remembered reading about the Epsom salt trick so I gave it a shot (read below for a quick synopsis).

After a few charging cycles and a lot of bubbly activity heard, the cart seems to work just as well as it did before.

Understand that this doesn't work for ""dead cells"", internal short circuits, or heavily corroded internals. This fix will only work with a relatively healthy, serviceable lead acid battery if the plates have heavy sulfation.

I guess my question is, how does a sulfate remove sulfation? Can anyone explain this? None of the places I've read this fix have actually gotten into the chemistry of why this works. Thanks!

509,,askscience,"I want to try and explain this phenomenon a bit better (I'm not even sure if it's real or an optical illusion), so I'll be as detailed as I can. 

I'm experiencing something weird with reflected light and the way my brain is trying to process it and I'm not sure if there have been any experiments done that might address it.

1. Say I have a red blinking light to my left, and a mirror to my right such that when I stare at a single point directly in between the two, I can see a perfectly symmetrical reflection of the light in the mirror. **Both lights are near my visual periphery in this scenario. Also, due to the speed of light, I assume that my brain would normally consider these two events as simultaneous.**
2. If I focus on that single middle point, I can become fully aware of both lights blinking in my periphery and I can sync their timing up together perfectly.
3. However, if I choose to continue staring at that center point but shift my *focus* to the right or left side (i.e. basically watching only one of the lights specifically out of the corner of my eye), my reaction to the second light blinking seems to be slightly after the light being focused on. This works both ways.
4. One reason it bugs me is that I can't make the process happen in reverse. For example, staring at center point, Focusing on Light A in my periphery, and convincing my brain to react and process Light B blinking *before* it processes the light from Light A. If I try to ""switch"" them, my brain becomes aware that it actually just shifted *focus* to Light B and now Light A is in the periphery.

I am curious if this is due to how our brain evolved to use our entire field of vision while focusing on specific points and is basically limited by the amount of information it could process per unit time. I just read something about Eagles having a higher ""Nyquist Rate"" and wonder if that has any relevance to what I'm getting at here, but more on the software side and less on the hardware, if you get what I mean.

The main reason I am asking is because of the potential applications for neuroscience and AI. Mapping the human mind based on how many bits of information we can process at a given moment, what we have to focus on, the stimulus/reaction delay for things in our focus vs. things in our periphery, etc.

561,,askscience,"According to the wikipedia page on the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, the amount of Polonium in his body was pretty low (Although, of course, any amount of Polonium is much too much), and it took him three weeks to die:

&gt;The symptoms seen in Litvinenko appeared consistent with an administered activity of approximately 2 GBq (50 mCi) which corresponds to about 10 micrograms of 210Po. That is 200 times the median lethal dose of around 238 μCi or 50 nanograms in the case of ingestion.

&gt;The studies of the biodistribution of 210Po using gamma-ray spectrometry in post-mortem samples were used to estimate intake as 4.4 GBq.

Having read about Litvinenko, I was curious about what would happen if someone was made to ingest a larger dose of Polonium (Or another strong alpha emitter). According to the wikipedia page on Polonium, a one gram sample of Po 210 produces 140 watts of power, so it seems like the human body should be able to 'sustain' a much higher amount than Litvinenko swallowed without the heat destroying the body before the radiation kills you.

So... what's the chain of events that leads to death? Reading up on Acute Radiation Syndrome, all the information talks about radiation suffered from external sources, mostly the victims of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. But what about someone dying from a strong alpha emitter inside the body?

585,,askscience,"I’m **Ed Damiano**, and for nearly 20 years I’ve been developing bionic pancreas technology to automate blood-sugar control.

When my infant son, David, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, my wife and I learned quickly how hard it was to get insulin dosing right in managing his blood-sugar levels, especially in such a small child. I began to imagine a wearable bionic pancreas that would automatically manage his blood-sugar levels without our intervention or his, when he grew up and became responsible for his own care.

Inspired by David’s diagnosis, I began developing, testing, and refining bionic pancreas technology. My students, postdocs, and I began conducting experiments at Boston University testing an early version of the device running on a laptop computer in 2005. Together with our clinical collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we progressed to in-patient trials in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in 2008. Between 2013 and 2018, my team at BU and our clinical collaborators conducted over a dozen outpatient and home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes, testing various mobile versions of our bionic pancreas technology, which was developed and refined in my lab at BU.

In 2015, I co-founded Beta Bionics®, Inc., a Massachusetts Public Benefit Corporation that is committed to the singular mission of commercializing a bionic pancreas for people with diabetes and other disorders of blood sugar regulation. Beta Bionics licensed the bionic pancreas technology from BU in 2015. Since then, Beta Bionics has developed a purpose-built, fully integrated, wearable, closed-loop device - referred to as the iLet® bionic pancreas - that is designed to automate blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes. Over the past two years, the iLet® bionic pancreas has been tested in several home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. 440 adults and children with type 1 diabetes are currently being screened for enrollment into a phase 3 clinical trial testing the iLet bionic pancreas at 16 clinical sites across the US. The clinical data from this study will support a market application for the iLet bionic pancreas to the US FDA.

Here’s a short video from the documentary, about my story: https://youtu.be/1j6rmx0De7A

Because ""Blood Sugar Rising"" is partnering with PBS series NOVA for outreach around the film, I'll be posting under NOVA's account: u/novapbs. I am looking forward to answering your questions about my family, my work, and about the latest medical technology being created to address the diabetes epidemic in America. I'll be answering your questions beginning at noon EDT on Friday, April 17.

&lt;p&gt;When my infant son, David, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, my wife and I learned quickly how hard it was to get insulin dosing right in managing his blood-sugar levels, especially in such a small child. I began to imagine a wearable bionic pancreas that would automatically manage his blood-sugar levels without our intervention or his, when he grew up and became responsible for his own care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by David’s diagnosis, I began developing, testing, and refining bionic pancreas technology. My students, postdocs, and I began conducting experiments at Boston University testing an early version of the device running on a laptop computer in 2005. Together with our clinical collaborators at the Massachusetts General Hospital, we progressed to in-patient trials in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in 2008. Between 2013 and 2018, my team at BU and our clinical collaborators conducted over a dozen outpatient and home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes, testing various mobile versions of our bionic pancreas technology, which was developed and refined in my lab at BU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, I co-founded Beta Bionics®, Inc., a Massachusetts Public Benefit Corporation that is committed to the singular mission of commercializing a bionic pancreas for people with diabetes and other disorders of blood sugar regulation. Beta Bionics licensed the bionic pancreas technology from BU in 2015. Since then, Beta Bionics has developed a purpose-built, fully integrated, wearable, closed-loop device - referred to as the iLet® bionic pancreas - that is designed to automate blood glucose control in people with type 1 diabetes. Over the past two years, the iLet® bionic pancreas has been tested in several home-use clinical trials in adults and children with type 1 diabetes. 440 adults and children with type 1 diabetes are currently being screened for enrollment into a phase 3 clinical trial testing the iLet bionic pancreas at 16 clinical sites across the US. The clinical data from this study will support a market application for the iLet bionic pancreas to the US FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is featured in the new PBS documentary &amp;quot;Blood Sugar Rising,&amp;quot; which premiered Wednesday night. You can stream the film on pbs.org or on the PBS Video App on your Smart TV. &lt;a href=""http://pbs.org/bloodsugarrising""&gt;http://pbs.org/bloodsugarrising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

615,,askscience,"As per this subreddit's rules, a cursory google search shows that I should be able to calculate the answer with Kepler's 3rd Law, where the period squared is equal to the semi-major axis cubed. but while this may work on paper, in practice none of the actual Mars missions have followed the theoretical values.

Every tutorial I find online assumes that Earth and Mars are in circular concentric orbits (which they aren't) and that the probes themselves travel exactly 180 degrees from one side of the sun to the other (which they don't).

**Math time:** Earth's semi-major axis is 1 AU, Mars' semi-major axis s 1.523679 AU.  This means the Mars probe's semi-major axis is 1.2618395 AU.  Applying Kepler's 3rd Law gives us a period of 1.417445 years.  180 degrees is half an orbit, so every Mars mission should take 0.708722 years (259 days), but the real world values vary wildly; the shortest mission took 131 days (Mariner 7), and the longest took 334 (Mars Polar Lander)

The distance between Earth and Mars is not uniform, so how do space agencies calculate the launch windows?  How do they know exactly when to launch and how long it will take for their probes to reach Mars?  How do they account for the eccentric orbits?  Is there a more complex formula than Kepler's 3rd Law?

I feel like I'm asking too much at once.  I apologize if my train of thought has gone off the rails.  Let me know if this question doesn't make any sense.

625,,askscience,"Recently, I was discussing evolution with my dad (who has a PhD in Geology) which led to the topics of radiometric dating.

My  understanding is the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, give or take 50  million. I recently learned that the earliest fossil evidence on Earth  is bacteria records from 3.5 billion years ago. I also believe these  numbers are pretty accurate because radiometric dating is pretty  accurate, at least based on my basic reading of the research on it.

This is his understanding of those points:

1. The Earth's age could be ""any age older than 100 million years old.""
2. The  earliest fossil records are algae and these are 1 billion years old (if  the radiometric dating is to be believe to be that precise). He also  mentioned that people often claim they've found some random earlier  fossil record but none of it is widely accepted by the geological  community. And more specifically, that bacteria (which I thought was the  earliest fossil record) can't even fossilize.
3. Finally,  that radiometric dating has too much uncertainty too it (which is why  the Earth's age could be as low as 100 million rather than 4.5B).  Specifically, the uncertainty lies in the fact that if radiometric  dating says the Earth is 4.5B, how can we even know that the radioactive  decay stays constant throughout? How can we know precisely that the  some of the half-lifes get on the order of hundred of millions years  old? In essence, there  are far too many geological events and uncertainty to assume what we  measure in the present day and in human time scales to be constant going  back the history of the Earth.

What  are your thoughts and understandings of those points? I'm an engineer  and not at all a geological expert but I thought my understanding of  those points were widely accepted.

That is a very efficient way to learn &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; science and I wondered if it is possible to learn economics that way. In any case, how did you learn it ?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m deeply worried for the robustness of our understanding of economics, on the one hand from economists themselves (is it a science?) and on the other hand from the major part of a country&amp;#39;s population. Especially in these times, keeping key thematics unreachable for the bulk of the population, such as world/country economics, is a threat to doing the right choices as a citizen.&lt;br/&gt;
That is why I&amp;#39;m asking here and hopefully not insulting anyone with these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

682,,askscience," I have a question about DC and AC Conductivity for Metals (conductors) Vs Dielectrics (insulators)? It may be easier to explain what I understand, and have people correct me.

For Conducting Metals, DC conductivity is usually very high. As the frequency increases the combined DC and AC conductivity starts to decrease (following Drude model), and it does so like a low pass filter so that the total conductivity of the metal is decreasing with frequency (Due to free charge mobility, and skin effect?)

For Dielectrics, the story is reversed. DC conductivity is usually very low, as they are insulators. As the frequency increases the AC conductivity increases, increasing the total system conductivity and lowering overall resistance following the universal dielectric response model. The physics here may have to do with molecular/ionic resonances, so the increase with frequency is not linear, and has peaks corresponding to resonances.

Please correct me if/where I am wrong. Please also tell me if I am right:)

707,,askscience,"I understand cellular respiration fairly well. Animals take in O2 + a carbohydrate(or fat/other food) from the environment and release CO2 + metabolites. The reaction is exothermic because the outputs are more stable than the inputs, thus energy is released.

It appears to me, the common way we understand the human metabolism is that we burn a certain amount of calories and these calories come from the food we eat. The oxygen consumed is simply required for the chemical reactions to occur.  However, when i look at the equation, it looks like we are extracting some energy from the oxygen itself, given that CO2 is more stable than O2.

Is it even reasonable to say for example, ""10% of the energy/calories we use each day comes from the oxygen we breath""? If this is a reasonable thing to say, then what is the correct percentage, approximately? Is it as simple as calculating the total bond energy of the oxygen we consume per day and subtracting the bond energy of the CO2 we create? Or is my thinking here entirely incorrect?

I also have the same question regarding combustion reactions, which in my mind, are very similar. They are also much simpler chemically given the outputs are water and CO2 instead of APT which itself is just another storage molecule similar to carbohydrates.

I’m in a patho class and while reading a chapter on neoplasms I didn’t understand where a neoplasms capsule originates from. Our book specifically states that: “Benign tumors usually consist of differentiated cells that reproduce at a higher than normal rate.

However, the text never elaborates where the capsule originates; my instructor also didn’t know the answer. 

A google search led me to ScienceDirect, where the article states that a neoplasm’s capsule is “primarily the product of the elaboration of tumor stroma. In addition, the tumor capsule may derive in part from the fibrous debris resulting from necrotic cell death of tissue cells adjacent to the neoplasm.”

The answer seems relatively clear cut, when there is abnormal growth nearby necrosis creates a capsule around said growth. Cool, so is the rate and pattern the primary contributing factors for a benign tumor to be encapsulated?

I think information is powerful. The more we have the better. That is why testing for Covid-19 is so vital and why our limited access is so frustrating.

* An article by a chemistry Professor: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants)

* And the Mayo Clinic: [https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-expert-explains-what-soap-does-to-sars-cov-2-virus/)

Some claim it is indeed the most effective method.

The claim is that the virus has a lipid layer, and therefore soap or detergent will interfere with that layer and is therefore a highly effective way of destroying the virus.

However, I have not been able to find any actual research to back this claim.  

The only study I have found that tested this is here: [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext#sec1)

In that study, they compared several disinfectants, including hand soap.  Out of all tested, hand soap was the only disinfectant found to still have active virus after 5 minutes.  That is, it was the worst performer.

The CDC lists disinfectants believed to be effective against the virus, but not included in that list is detergent.  In their recommendations the suggest using detergent or soap followed by a disinfectant:

&gt;If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cleaning-disinfection.html)

To be clear, I am not asking whether washing your hands with soap is effective, as I understand there is plenty of good evidence for this.

Hi Reddit! I’m Lori Pennington-Gray, Director of the Eric Friedheim Tourism Institute at the University of Florida. Right now, we are working on a study that assesses travel related to concerns about COVID-19 with weekly trends. We are including variables like threat appraisal, future travel decisions, trusted sources and travel anxiety index.

I have completed numerous research projects in Florida as well in countries such as Canada, Mexico, Korea, South Africa, Russia, Peru and others throughout the Caribbean.

I focus on the following research topics at the University of Florida:

- Decision-making process related to travel during crises
- Tourism crisis management
- Environmental and social impacts to a host destination
- Tourism marketing
- Visitors behaviors with destination marketing organizations policy

More about me:

I received my Ph.D. in Park, Recreation and Tourism Resources from Michigan State University in 1999, my M.S. in Leisure Studies from Pennsylvania State University in 1994 and my B.A. in Recreation and Leisure Studies from University of Waterloo in 1993. I have consulted with several destination marketing organizations to design research projects. 

I lead the Tourism Crisis Management Initiative, established in 2007, where we aim to develop ways to manage the tourism industry during crises by implementing methods of crisis reduction, readiness, response and recovery. I am a member of the International Ecotourism Society, the Travel and Tourism Research Association, the World Travel and Tourism Council, and many other associations related to the tourism industry.

But ears DO cross hemispheres:

Or does more viral cells on the first contact makes for a more severe infection later on? I.e. a disease may be mild or even unnoticeable if you got infected by few cells early on or may be a life threatening situation if you get a large infection right on the start.
