**This Episode**

This episode stars Anya Jabour, professor at the University of Montana and author of the excellent book *Sophonisba Breckinridge: Championing Women's Activism in Modern America.* The book uses the extraordinary Breckinridge (1866-1948) as a window into social justice and activism in the first half of the 20th century. She was involved in almost everything you can imagine. What really distinguishes her, however, is her feminist and academic research-based approach that underlay her more traditional ""activist"" actions.

9,,AskHistorians,"We hear a lot of suggestions for things to change about the subreddit. Some are easy enough to reject, others we give serious thought to, and occasionally, we get a really good one that helps us develop changes for the subreddit. But by far there is no suggestion we hear more than the request that we implement ""Answered"" flair, which is something that we, perhaps infamously, have not done despite this. 

While it is a suggestion that seems self-evident to many, unfortunately, it isn't quite so straightforward an idea. And while we aren't opposed to it per se, we are opposed to implementation of such a scheme in a way that wouldn't be fair and equitable in application, not to mention something which can be administered easily and in a uniform manner. As such, there are a number of impediments, both practical and philosophical, that prevent us from putting such a flair into effect.

###There is Rarely *One* Answer

One of the biggest issues facing such a scheme comes down to the historical method itself. Different historians can look at the same evidence, and come to different conclusions. Neither one is necessarily invalid, and the debate between those competing positions can tell us just as much about a topic as the answers themselves, sometimes more even as it can help suss out details and thoughts on the process itself. In a space such as these, we generally do *not* want to endorse one perspective over another. Ideally, an answer on a topic which is subject to hot debate within the academy should make that clear enough itself, but we, as moderators, not only don't want to take sides there, but we simply *shouldn't* be seen as favoring one academic interpretation over another. 

Just as we remove comments in a thread because of how the first comment, whatever its quality, can so often become the 'hot' comment of a thread, we likewise don't want to be crediting as 'answered' a thread because the first comment which meets the rules has arrived. Put simply, we aren't endorsing *anything* here as the definitive answer. Responses which are not removed meet certain criteria which reflect fidelity to the historical method, but history is a process, and rarely do we end up with so definitive a picture that we can reject *any and all* alternatives with certainty.

####Stifling of Contributions

Closely tied into this is what such a flair would potentially do to the quality of content in the subreddit. We aren't simply speculating, but know well from many discussions with Flaired contributors, that the presence of ""Answered"" flair on a thread would make them less inclined to contribute further. An answer in the thread might be *decent* and just enough to justify being left up, but there is a ton more to say, or another important angle to offer. With 'Answered' flair there is simply less incentive to do so. It gives the thread a sense of finality that disincentives further contributions. 

####Workflow of Moderation

Moderating is often like being a grad student TA, assigned to a class that isn't actually in your focus. We can evaluate a lot about an answer using general principles of the historical method. We can consider the construction of the arguments, and how well the piece communicates its information. We can check sources and see whether they a) exist b) are well reviewed and c) make mention of the topics at hand. But we aren't *all* experts on *everything*. Between the whole team, we have an incredibly wide coverage, but we necessarily must do triage at times.

Say a question about 12th century France is posted. I, knowing nothing about the topic, can evaluate an answer on the criteria noted above, and decide is passes the smell test. Or maybe I think there is *something* fishy, but can't quite put my finger on it, but either way, I decide that there isn't justification for removal based on my reading *but* in either case, while not removing it, I'll flag it to the attention of the mod team's medievalists to have a look. When they are able to, they will also give it a look. Maybe they decide it is fine. But maybe they pick up on something that I wouldn't be aware of. From *there*, we have several approaches. If bad enough, obviously, we'll remove and warn the user. If it is missing something major, we might remove it with a DM explaining the issue and suggestions on how to fix it after which we review to reinstate. Or maybe the issue is kind of in that grey area, in which case we would leave it up *for now* but with some pointed follow-up question to try and suss out a bit more from the user, and only remove if their response indicates that they are already past the extent of their knowledge.

So the question is... at what point does the ""Answered"" flair go up? Is it when I first decide ""smells OK""? But it might still be removed later! Is it after the 'in-field' mod makes their first assessment? Still might be removed depending on the latter stages. For some cases, it can easily be several stages over 24 hours for a response is *definitely* there to stay. Even beyond standard workflow, there are plenty of other things that might happen. Perhaps it turns out a response was plagiarized, so must be removed. Perhaps a respondent refuses to provide sources after request, so must be removed. And of course, because it was originally noted as ""answered"", other potential respondents already decided not to bother!

####Mechanics of the Flair

Even if we are able to work through all of those issues, which is easier said than done, just how is this being applied? In the end, it needs to be applied manually by the mods. Although there are ways that flair can be automated with bots, those are ""dumb"" solutions, which is to say, a bot can know there is a comment in the thread with at least 700 words or something, but it can't know if they are *good* words.

Likewise, although the creator of a thread can add flair themselves, beyond the fact that it isn't something we can assume will be done consistently, it also isn't up to the OP to judge the quality of the response as it is in some other subreddits such as /r/AskHistory. A response may be posted, they may read it and add the flair before a mod sees it... only for the mod to quickly see glaring issues that might not be obvious to a layperson, but utterly sink the quality from a more informed view.

So in the end, it would have to be something the mod team does manually, only after evaluation of an answer. This places a burden on us beyond what we already carry, as it creates a number of pressures, including to act quicker than we currently do, and also to be more accurate in our assessments of answers than we already are.

####Pressure on the Mods

We know that this subreddit can sometimes be frustrating. We wish every question could get a great answer immediately, but that just isn't so. It takes time, and not every question will get a response in the end. And while this impulse in large part drives the desire for 'Answered' Flair, there are knock-on effects that must also be considered, and a big one is the pressure it puts on the mods to *get it right*. This builds off of the issues already addressed, but the long term impact of that needs to be considered. There is a difference between passive and active approval. Allowing a response to stand is passive - ""read through, checked sources, looks good"" - whereas stating that a thread is *answered* is active. All else being the same, it must be kept in mind that *the presence of 'Answered' Flair would almost certainly result in fewer questions being answered* simply due to the pressure on the mod team to ensure that flair is deserved. 

As these Roundtables have already made clear, moderation is a holistic consideration, where we weigh different factors to arrive at a decision, and this would simply be adding an additional factor to that calculation, and one which is *always in favor of removal*. Going back to the issue of workflow for instance, there are number of different points where the ""Answered"" flair could maybe be applied, but many of them might result in it being taken down, which is absolutely the worst case scenario, but it might very well be 24 hours before we feel confident enough in putting it up there!

###Unanswered Flair Though!?

""Ok, ok, ok,"" you are saying. ""But what about something else?"" Alternative suggestions such as ""Unanswered"" have been made in the past, but that essentially has the same problems as before, just inverting how we view them. Whatever issues are present in giving ""Answered"" flair are basically the same in removing ""Unanswered"" flair. Similarly, while ""Content Present"" or other suggestions which attempt to offer a more neutral description that ""Answered"" to lessen *some* of the issues, they don't erase them entirely.

###What We Do Have!

Trust me when I say that if we thought it would work, we would implement it. If nothing else it would get y'all to stop asking! We really do take it seriously though, and probably once a year, at least, we have a discussion on the matter to see whether anything has changed, but for better or for worse, little does.

But while 'Answered' flair might not be in play, we do our best to provide several alternatives to give users the best browsing experience we can, and to enjoy as much content as possible.

42,,AskHistorians,"I read about the Battle of Kleidion and how Basil II, who came to be known as the Bulgar Slayer, had almost 15,000 captured Bulgarians blinded. He purportedly left 1 of ever 100 man blind in only one eye so that he could lead the other 99 home. Something about this seems odd to me. My questions are this:

1) How would one physically blind 15,000 people in the 11th century (hot knife, oil)?

2) Why would 15,000 the Bulgars sit there and wait to be blinded after getting captured? 15,000 sounds like a large number of people to control, even if unarmed, and trying to stop them from knowing what was about to happen sounds just as difficult.

&gt;Noam Chomsky's Year 501 is a powerful and comprehensive discussion of the incredible injustices hidden in our history and there is little in that history that escapes Chomsky's attention.

&gt;He ruthlessly interrogates the ""official record"" calling up the muted voices of the victims of aggression to give testimony. From the brutality of Christopher Columbus upon his arrival in the Americas to the persecution of Indonesians in the 1960s, he appeals to the reader to review the evidence amassed over the last 500 years.

Here is a brief review of the book: 

&gt;The sun hasn't set on imperialism, according to famed linguist and radical thinker Chomsky (*The Chomsky Reader*, 1987, etc.) in this forceful analysis of global economics. Chomsky asserts that the post-WW II partition of Germany was beneficial to the West; that, according to World Bank figures, protectionism reduces national income in the Third World by about twice the amount provided by foreign aid; that Eastern Europe is going to return to a ""Third World service role""; that state intervention and dirigisme have been necessary in every case of successful industrial development—the very ""economic nationalism"" that US policy explicitly opposes in the Third World. What it all adds up to, Chomsky contends, is calculated, antidemocratic, exploitative manipulation of world capital, resources, and markets—as well as seizing of the moral high ground—by industrialized nations, particularly the US. Chomsky's defense of political correctness (""There...are a great many people who oppose racist and sexist oppression..."") is a bit glib, and his dominant thesis—that the world is rigged by the rich and powerful, nations as well as individuals—is one that he's argued before, but he has a knack for sharp comparisons (noting, for example, that ""the logic of the annexation of Texas was essentially that attributed to Saddam Hussein by US propaganda after his conquest of Kuwait"") and, at its best, what he offers is a compelling statement of a worldview usually found on bumper stickers.

For example, modern Russia, USSR and Imperial Russia are all seems to follow the same process in dealing with its targeted neighbor: creation of puppet  state&amp;#39;s or &amp;quot;People Republics&amp;quot;. The most recent are People&amp;#39;s Republics in Ukraine (Donetsk, Lugansk, Crimea) in 2014 to legitimize Russian&amp;#39; aggression. The earliest, to my knowledge, are regional confederations in Poland of 18 century during the partition of Poland. 
Was such operational procedure Russian Empire&amp;#39;s invention? Do other super powers and empires had favorite (well developed) procedures in dealing with targeted neighbors? 
Is there any reading covering studies on this topic?&lt;/p&gt;

143,,AskHistorians,"Hey all,

I was reading Moshe Lewin's book The Soviet Century, and he had this to say about Soviet prison camps in the 1920's: 

"" Students of the justice and prison systems during the 1920s (the NEP period) know that camps were intended to be a more humane form of detention than the cages' in what were called prisons: labour in conditions approximating to a normal workplace was considered the best means of re educating and rehabilitating people. At the time, conditions in the camps were far from rigorous, with the exception of those that held political prisoners notably on the Solovki Islands on the White Sea, which was the sole camp under the jurisdiction of the GPU. Serious criminals were, of course, closely guarded, but some of those detained worked in the camp during the day and returned home for the night. Courts sought to limit prison sentences, opt ing instead for penalties of 'obligatory labour' (prinud-roboty) - sometimes mistranslated in the West as 'forced labour'. The expression in fact meant keeping the same job, but paying a fine deducted at source for the term fixed by the sentence. The penal system was being experimented with; and the literature and debates on crime and punishment were public and innovative.

However, the liberalism of the NEP period in penal policy suffered from an objective limit: too little meaningful work for the re-education of prisoners.

The country had a high unemployment rate and the unemployed had to have priority in access to work.

All this came to end in the 1930s, even if liberal notions lingered on for some time. Judges and criminalogists fought a losing battle against the camps becoming an instrument of punishment through labour (in fact, forced labour), thereby losing their original purpose of re-education through labour.""

This sounds really fascinating, and I'd love any more readings or information anyone has about the system, or the theory behind it. All I've been able find so far is stuff by or about Evgeny Pashukanis (https://www.marxists.org/archive/pashukanis/index.htm)

My question is this:

We are talking about the late 1700s / early 1800s here. They did not have computers, they did not have cameras, they did not have social security numbers.

If they did have some kind of identity documents, they were surely a one-off type of hand written document that could be easily forged (even in the US in the early 1900's, a hundred years later, ID cards were comically simple- hand written, and many without a photo; those that did have photos were not laminated and were easily switched)

So what forced him to use his real name? How would a town on the other side of the country have any idea that this random guy is a criminal? If a man did commit a crime, there wouldn't be more than a handful of people who know what his face looks like.

Taking a page from movies and video games... You would have to be a serious big time murderer before you started getting badly drawn wanted posters hung up countrywide. Even then the likeness wasn't great.

In Les Mis, he simply tears up his parole papers and throws them to the wind. Why would anyone NOT do that?

Even in 2020 in the US, it's not at all difficult to get a fake ID. It's a bit more difficult to get one from a legit source, but still possible for someone with motivation and money. Back then in 1800 how hard could it have been? You roll into town, tell them you were robbed by highwaymen, and that you need a new ID document... or whatever. You get the idea. It's not like they can pick up the phone and call your village to verify who you are. Even if they sent a raven, where would they send it to? I'm guessing there was no central repository in Paris that kept records of every serf born on a dirt floor in rural France.

What kind of documents even existed back then to prove who you were? 

Can someone explain how someone could be identified as a criminal, once they left their hometown and traveled far from everyone who knows their face, in that period? Or how they kept track of ordinary citizens even?

It doesn't even have to be France- anywhere else would make a good answer too. As long as its from a time before photographs were invented, and after whenever they stopped tattooing ""FUGITIVUS"" to people's foreheads. (That is from one of my favorite historically-accurate shows, Spartacus (2010)) 

I will admit it was a very effective way to mark a runaway slave. Also demonstrated when Brad Pitt marks the Jew Hunter with a forehead swastika at the end of IGB... I'm actually surprised more societies didn't do this. If they really wanted to mark Valjean as a ""dangerous man"" for life, why not a big forehead tattoo?

I'm assuming that this would have been in her childhood in the UK pre-WW2. She's passed on now so I can't ask, but was wondering if anyone had any idea where this prejudice would have come from? I know that the UK and Portugal weren't at war in this period and I'm wondering if there was any underlying reason for this distrust.

My first thought was that a lot of Children's books at the time featured smugglers as villains, and maybe there was some sort of real or imagined relationship between Portugal and smuggling.

She grew up in Manchester in a community of very left leaning factory workers, so I also supposed that  it might have had something to do with workers' struggles. Was the Portuguese government maybe particularly repressive at the time?

243,,AskHistorians,"Hello there. I am quite new to this sub, so I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question. If it isn't, don't delete my post, just show me where to ask.

Anyway, here is my question:

So, the story that I am writing is set in a world that imitates the world in the 15th century, with the continent the heroes are currently in resembling 15th century Europe (and a bit of 15th century scandinavia in the north). I'm talking feudalism, knights, local lords, big (and polytheist) church, but with magic and dragons. However, cartridge firing guns (double action revolvers and single shot long guns) exist. They latter aren't rare, and the average royal soldier will have one, and most local militias use normal medieval weapons (polearms and swords) along with Martini-Henry like guns. Officers, nobles and knights also usually own a revolver. My questions are:

1: How effective were guns (even muzzleloaders) against chest-plates? Was armour a good idea in the early days of marksmanship? The revolvers in my story fire cartridges based on .32 S&amp;W/7.65 Browning, .38 special and .45 ACP, while rifles fire somethig comparable to the .303 cartridge. Would it make sense for a knight to wear a chestplate and a helmet, or even a whole suit of armour (with more flexible and comfortable gloves for better shooting and slashing?)

2: Long guns are exclusively crown property, which means that the bow has remained the go-to hunting weapon. However its not uncommon to see people with revolvers and/or swords. The idea is that revolvers are meant for self defense by soldiers and whoever can afford one, but are seen as ""uncivil"" since they don't rely on tradition and ""manliness"". Is that a good idea? 

3: How much was a sword worth in late medieval times? Revolvers are priced a bit higher than simple swords due to them being a new invention thay only recently arrived to the continent, who ever manufactures them locally does so for a very large price, and ammo isn't cheap either.

283,,AskHistorians,"Hi, r/AskHistorians,

I have recently taken an interest in world history. I started with history from my country and then my own greater region. I also learn about the history of mankind, the history of wars, economic history, political history. 

I wonder as I absorb all of this historical learnings, whether there is a good framework for absorbing history in an objective and analytical way. For example, are there certain structured questions that I should ask myself whilst reading and learning? We are all equipped with a logical mind but it seems to me that the pursuit of learning history is one that requires more than just that; our minds have many cognitive biases, after all. Moreover, I tend to find myself searching through Wikipedia and Youtube. I wonder if these paint a complete picture of historical events. 

With this said, do you have any history learning tips for a non-academic history layman like myself? How do you approach learning about a historic topic? Do you adopt any kind of structured or habitual approach? Are there useful tools that you use? Do you write notes in a particular way? 

One of the things that I do is to create a log of important events in history and see the relativity of their dates.

""Arglwydd"" I take to mean lord in a general sense, that's simple enough, but where does ""Pendeuic"" fit in?

370,,AskHistorians,"**Main question:** What impact did Roman colonization from settling retired legionaries in ""colonias"" in Gaul and merchants from throughout the Roman mediterranean world have on the composition of the population of Roman Gaul, relative to pre-conquest times? 

Do we have any way of knowing how many Roman (e.g. Italians and Roman citizens from other parts of the mediterranean world) settled in Gaul during the 1st century and in the subsequent centuries? 

For example, when veterans of the Roman army were granted lands in the region to form colonies, how many Roman settlers were there in these colonies? Were they made up only Roman men or Roman men and their families as well? Did whole swaths of merchants and laborers join these veteran soldiers in founding a colony? 

At what point (if any) were Roman colonists a sizable minority relative to the native Gallic (Celtic speaking) population?

The reason I ask this is because today's ethnically French population, although varied in its looks, has a range of stereotypical phenotypes that look distinctively ""French"" and that ""French look"" does not look ""northern European"". The average Frenchman certainly does not look Germanic or Nordic which isn't surprising considering that the Franks, Burgundians, Visigoths, etc settled in small numbers relative to the much larger Gallo-Roman population.

What is surprising though is that the modern French also do not look ""Celtic"" - they bear little resemblance to Celtic nations today in the British Isles for example. And while ""Celtic"" is correctly understood to be more of a cultural designation, in antiquity the Gaulish people of modern France were always described as being taller than the Italians and Greeks, with a predominance of lighter features and bigger builds. This description mirrors that of typical Northern Europeans as tall, fair skinned, and blond - at least relative to Mediterranean peoples (Italians, Greeks, Iberians, North Africans, Levantine peoples, etc)

While light features are common to France and while the French tend to have lighter features than say Italians for example, French people as a whole have darker features (hair and eyes) and are of slighter build and shorter stature than Northern Europeans (Germans, Dutch, Scandinavians, etc). The ""stereotypical"" French person bears more resemblance to their Latin speaking cousins in Italy and Spain than they do to Germanic speaking northerners or to their supposedly ""Celtic"" brethren in Britain and Ireland.

My question is why? If the greater part of Gaul was inhabited by Celts who were described to be distinctively looking by the Romans (aka - Italians in the 1st century BC) then what happened to them in the intervening 2,000 years? To what degree did Italian (and other Mediterranean people's settlement in Roman Gaul) impact the gene pool of modern France?

Most people inquire about the impact of the Franks and other Germanic tribes on the people of France. But based on how French people look, to me the more natural question is what impact did being part of the Roman Empire have on the Gauls?

When or why did they lose their connection / relation to their mother nation?&lt;/p&gt;

384,,AskHistorians,"Hispania Tarraconensis was one of the three roman provinces in Hispania, and it covered most of nowadays Spain, with the exception of the SW. It's size it's close to 500 000 km2, and the only other ""provinces"" that are close to this size are Italy (which was not really a province) and Egypt, which was also not exactly a province (it was a personal Kingdom of the Emperor, if I am not mistaken).  


Later when Diocletian assumed power he divided Tarraconensis into three smaller provinces, which made them similar in size to others, but that still leaves us with 300 years of a province spanning 1200km in length and a huge variety of ecosystem:high mountains, wet hills to the north, harsh steppe in the middle, mediterranean ecosystem in the east, and even some desert in the south-east.

It sounds like it would be hell to manage such a huge area, specially from the distant provincial capital at Tarraco, which is 1200km away from the north-westernmost point in current Galicia. Nowadays this distance takes around 11h by car, and in ancient times I imagine it could take up to a month by foot, maybe a couple of weeks by horse and at least a week by boat, having to circumnavigate the whole Peninsula.

I understand Baetica was the richest and most populated region in Hispania, and had been for a thousand years, so it makes sense to keep it as a separate province. It also had a distinct native culture from the other parts of the Peninsula, a mix of Tartessian and Punic heritage. Following this logic, Tarraconensis should have included the eastern areas of the peninsula and the Ebro valley, which have a similar climate and ecosystem as well as a shared Greco-Iberian cultural heritage.

431,,AskHistorians,"So like with any good post, this was inspired by an internet argument. I was arguing on Youtube trying to slay some Lost Cause dragons, with plenty of primary source citations. I see it as my civic duty tbh. 

It was started by this comment, ""Lost Causers are like guys who will explain all the reasons why their  relationship didn't work out without mentioning cheating on their girlfriend being the chief cause."" 

I covered a lot of ground such as: why poor non slave owning whites fought so hard to keep slavery, the causes both big picture and granular events, ""War of Northern Aggression"" BS, the concerted effort to re-write history by the UDC and Jubal Early and Jefferson Davis, the legendary picture of Lee, and the character assassinations of Longstreet and Grant, why saying it was ""states right's"" implying that it was something not racist and not slavery is just really dumb and wrong, Southern Unionists, the variety of viewpoints and attitudes towards slavery and secession, the fact that the Confederacy was actively trying to spread slavery (Golden Circle), comparisons to slavery in the past, the history of the KKK, reconstruction, the political factions and parties, how the Union weren't angels but they were closer than the Confederates, all the stuff that isn't controversial to historians and that they have moved past.

One last sidebar, there was a person on r/AskAnAmerican, who said s/he was a history major at VT, and was talking about the Slaveholder's Rebellion, and got downvoted, but thankfully, in addition, people gave actual helpful responses, and this person realized that they were being fed BS, that's why reading primary sources is really important. Maybe during the quarantine I'll write a well cited, more lay book addressing all this stuff. 

But the other person was responding that the Confederacy wasn't super racist since all sorts of groups of people fought for the Confederacy.

&gt;""Thousands of blacks fought for the Confederacy like black Confederate sailor W. S Lewis from CSS Alabama, Cuban Woman Loretta Velasquez dressed as a man to fight for the Confederacy, Cherokee and Choctaw tribes fought for the Confederacy. The last Confederate General to stop fighting was Cherokee General Stand Watie. 10,000 Jews fought for the Confederacy, like Moses Ezekiel. 13,000 Hispanics and 3,000 Mexican-Texans fought for the Confederacy as well, like Santos Benavides. Hundreds of Asians fought for the Confederacy like Charles Chon."" 

So to address the groups, Black Confederates myth (was asking for clarification on auxiliaries like cooks and personal servants vs soldiers but recieved none). I conceded that perhaps under some specific definition, maybe there were certain cases, but that says nothing in comparison to the USCT and how the Union Army soldiers and officers became more abolitionist leaning vs the other side which was the opposite. 

For the American Indian tribes, I'm aware that there was a civil war within the civil war and that different tribes were split by this issue (Cherokee and John Ross vs Stand Watie factions come to mind).

Another group mentioned were Asians, but they were generally not very present in the USA at this point in time, and apparently there has been some cases found, in the double digitsish, but ultimately, its not much and doesn't count. Also apparently they would take more white-American sounding names too, and were counted as mulatto in Northern census-takers. 

I know that Hispanics/Latinos were involved just because they were part of the population, particularly in the Transmissippi theater, but did not have any particular loyalty, in part because the war was a bit different out west.

As to Jews, IIRC from my college and high school education, anti-Jewish sentiment in the USA, while it existed, wasn't as nearly as high as it was in Europe, and it seems that it was not inherited. Granted there was the Second KKK and the Know-nothings, but it never reached the same degree of prominence. Also it seems that Jews were perceived as ""White."" Did either side have a special connection to Jews?

Now to the specific people mentioned. I did some internet research, but I was finding a lot of crap claims and unreputable sources and I was busy IRL, but my impressions are as follows. The claim about W. S Lewis seems to possibly be true. Apparently the Confederate Navy wasn't as picky about having people of African descent on board, but I was unable to find specific documentation about rank and duties. According to one source, he and other people on the ship, received pensions at some point form South Carolina as a thanks.

The parts about Stand Watie and Moses Ezekiel are true it seems. According to Wikipedia, the Loretta Velasquez might be fake. Apparently the part about Charles Chon might be true? But the information was from the SCV.

472,,AskHistorians,"The musical *Chess* originated as a concept album in 1984 and made its stage debut in London in 1986. The music was written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA fame, and the lyrics were written by Tim Rice.

The musical primarily uses chess as a plot device and as a metaphor for the Cold War rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union. However, one song in the production called ""The Story of Chess"" purports to be a full abbreviated history of the board game from its invention to modern times. This song is usually the first song in the production and performed by an ensemble of pseudo-narrator characters (although this varies from staging to staging).

The full lyrics are [here](https://genius.com/Chess-in-concert-the-story-of-chess-lyrics), and a recording from 2008 can be heard [here](https://youtu.be/j930o4CLU20). In summary, the claims the song makes can be summarized as follows:

* Chess was invented about 1,500 years ago in a Hindu kingdom on the Indian subcontinent.
* According to a ""fairly vague report"" (i.e. legend), two children of a reigning queen fought for the right to inherit the throne, causing one to be killed. The surviving brother consulted with wise men, who invented chess as a way to demonstrate that it was the other brother's own fault that he died.
* Chess first gained significant popularity outside its country of origin after spreading to Persia (""boosted in the main by what is now Iran"").
* After that, ""the Arabs"" refined and redesigned it.
* As of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, chess was already widely popular in the Byzantine Empire (since ""every other refugee included in his bags a set"").
* It spread quickly in Europe during the Renaissance, owing in part to the influence of the ""leading figures"" of the time.
* The game took on its modern form in Europe during or after the Renaissance.

482,,AskHistorians,"This is something that I've been trying to find answer to for a while now. So, a common narrative about the WW2 Eastern Front goes like this: in 1941, the Soviet Army was caught in transition and was poorly prepared for the war; in 1942 and 1943, they gradually caught up with the Germans on operational and tactical levels; in 1944 and 1945, the Soviet Army had complete supremacy.

Why, then, did the Soviets continue to suffer significantly more casualties than the Germans in many major battles of 1944 and 45, sometimes many times more? Take [Operation Bagration](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bagration) for example (I'm just going to go with Wikipedia numbers from now on, trusting that they are well-sourced): 450,000 German vs 770,000 Soviet.

For April, the nod for the 'Users' Choice' went to /u/J-Force, who catapulted themselves into [""How do I join a trebuchet crew in late medieval France? Is it a family thing, are there interviews? What are some of the risks and benefits of my new career that are maybe less known?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/g47jw7/how_do_i_join_a_trebuchet_crew_in_late_medieval/fnzlz1v/?context=3).

Things stayed medieval with the 'Flairs' Choice' as well, with the panelists bestowing the honors upon /u/WelfOnTheShelf, who took us on a journey with their answer to [""What was Crusader ‘Tourism” like?

For April's 'Dark Horse' Award, recognizing the top-voted non-flair, it was close fought between several worthy candidates, but /u/wilymaker in the end edged out the competition with their answer to [""What was the effects of muskets during a battle, if bow and arrow were superior?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fw3nto/what_was_the_effects_of_muskets_during_a_battle/fmnvoy5/).

This month's 'Greatest Question', voted upon by the mods, went to [""When did lesbians, gay men, and transgender people come together to form the LGBT community?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/gamy7f/when_did_lesbians_gay_men_and_transgender_people/), asked by /u/Lurk_Puns. It unfortunately remains unanswered, but hopefully will still get the one it deserves.

Finally, April's Excellence in Flairdom award goes to /u/J2quared! You might recognize J2 from the excellent questions you've had the privilege to read the answers to, or maybe even to answer yourself! Even better: their recent questions, in particular, have made a major effort to draw attention to less popular areas of history, especially African-American studies. Thanks for being a bright presence in the sub, /u/J2quared!

Is it a family thing, are there interviews? What are some of the risks and benefits of my new career that are maybe less known?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things stayed medieval with the &amp;#39;Flairs&amp;#39; Choice&amp;#39; as well, with the panelists bestowing the honors upon &lt;a href=""/u/WelfOnTheShelf""&gt;/u/WelfOnTheShelf&lt;/a&gt;, who took us on a journey with their answer to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fxxqw6/what_was_crusader_tourism_like_where_the_knights/fn0z4p5/""&gt;&amp;quot;What was Crusader ‘Tourism” like? Where the knights and lords who participated ever in much danger, or was it more fixed and showy like much Tourism today?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For April&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;Dark Horse&amp;#39; Award, recognizing the top-voted non-flair, it was close fought between several worthy candidates, but &lt;a href=""/u/wilymaker""&gt;/u/wilymaker&lt;/a&gt; in the end edged out the competition with their answer to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fw3nto/what_was_the_effects_of_muskets_during_a_battle/fmnvoy5/""&gt;&amp;quot;What was the effects of muskets during a battle, if bow and arrow were superior?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, April&amp;#39;s Excellence in Flairdom award goes to &lt;a href=""/u/J2quared""&gt;/u/J2quared&lt;/a&gt;! You might recognize J2 from the excellent questions you&amp;#39;ve had the privilege to read the answers to, or maybe even to answer yourself! Even better: their recent questions, in particular, have made a major effort to draw attention to less popular areas of history, especially African-American studies.

Am I right that before modern 'police' as a concept, control was exercised by governments directly utilizing the military?

Edit:

OK, so in further reading I think I am starting to understand something here. Historically, there was often a well-trained, wealthy (quality weapon and armor owning) upper-class that was the core power of the military and ran the government or supported the government. This warrior class (whether of chariots, knights, etc.) might then rule over a citizen/working class that might be recruited as weaker, lighter armed forces who couldn't generally stand up to the power of the warrior class overall. Thus, power was often exercised over the working class as a source of wealth for the warriors - so the government wouldn't be concerned about conflict within the lower/working class so long as they didn't cause problems for the upper/warrior class.

In fact, I'm wondering if there are theories on if the form of weapon/wealth/skill holdings in military changing can result in major social transformations: i.e. gunpowder was an equalizer that made the old feudal military class obsolete (now the king/state/democracy) could recruit the working class and plow through the knights.

578,,AskHistorians,"Greetings,

many times I have read that the besieged Gauls during the siege of Alesia sent out the civilians of the Mandubii outside because of the lack of food supplies.

The usual story, repeated also by [the popular video by Invicta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqvgqJHZSg), is that Caesar realized the ploy and refused to let them pass or even enslave them, because he wanted the Gauls to take them back and waste their food supply faster.

Then Vercingetorix also bars them entry and thus they starve in no mans land between the fortifications, in full view of both armies.

However, when I looked into the source that everyone quotes on this, it is just Caesars Gallic Wars 7.78, and it merely states;

""The Mandubii, who had admitted them into the town, are compelled to go forth with their wives and children. When these came to the Roman fortifications, weeping, they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them with food. But Caesar, placing guards on the rampart, forbade them to be admitted.""

nothing further.

Nothing about the Gauls preventing them from returning to Alesia, the starvation is not stated in the following sections of the book.

&lt;p&gt;many times I have read that the besieged Gauls during the siege of Alesia sent out the civilians of the Mandubii outside because of the lack of food supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The usual story, repeated also by &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tqvgqJHZSg""&gt;the popular video by Invicta&lt;/a&gt;, is that Caesar realized the ploy and refused to let them pass or even enslave them, because he wanted the Gauls to take them back and waste their food supply faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Vercingetorix also bars them entry and thus they starve in no mans land between the fortifications, in full view of both armies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I looked into the source that everyone quotes on this, it is just Caesars Gallic Wars 7.78, and it merely states;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Mandubii, who had admitted them into the town, are compelled to go forth with their wives and children. When these came to the Roman fortifications, weeping, they begged of the soldiers by every entreaty to receive them as slaves and relieve them with food. But Caesar, placing guards on the rampart, forbade them to be admitted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing about the Gauls preventing them from returning to Alesia, the starvation is not stated in the following sections of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the following text immediately goes on the arriving Gallic relief army and the sallying out of the besieged army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there another source I am missing or is the second part of the story a tell tale that became repeated too many times?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the civilians just return back into Alesia?&lt;/p&gt;

For example: the main protagonist (Uhtred of Brunanburh) seems to be a few decades out of place from the one history remembers (Uhtred the Bold). As the show started an Uhtred of Brunanburh sent his son (also Uhtred of Brunanburh) to spy on approaching vikings. A viking returned with his head whereupon the father renamed his second son Uhtred of Brunanburh before he too (the father) is killed. This character (the second son) goes on to become enslaved by the invading Danes until his adopted family is killed and he is cast between the conflicting cultures in a pivotal role. By this time he is known as Uhtred Ragnarson the Dane Slayer. He goes on to be critical to the success of these English kings although he never gets credit for anything since he will not lie and say he believes in Christianity.

I know that sources for this period are scarce and highly motivated politically. For example, it is known that King Alfred's daughter (Æthelflæd) led and participated in several crucial battles for Mercia at that time but very little is written about her role in them. There are no accounts of that from Wessox. So my question is this: Is the portrayal of events given in the series at least plausible?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague\_of\_Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens)

Why was the naval power Athens so much more affected by the plague than the land power of Sparta?

Did the oligarchic nature of Sparta and the other powers of the Eastern Mediterranean help them deal with the plague better than the comparatively democratic Athens? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Aftermath\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plague_of_Athens&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6)\]  
&gt;  
&gt;The plague was an unforeseen event that resulted in one of the largest recorded loss of life in ancient Greece as well as a breakdown of Athenian society. The balance of power between citizens had changed due to many of the rich dying and their fortunes being inherited by remaining relatives of the lower class. According to Thucydides, those who had become ill and survived were the most sympathetic to others suffering: believing that they could no longer succumb to any illness, a number of survivors offered to assist with the remaining sick. The plague had also contributed to Athens' overall loss of power and ability to expand. Many of the remaining Athenians were found to be [metics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metic) who had forged their documentation or had bribed officials to hide their original status. A number of these people were reduced to slaves once they were caught. This resulted in stricter laws dictating who can become an Athenian citizen, reducing both their number of potential soldiers and amount of political power, but also a decline in treatment and rights for metics in Athens. [\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens#cite_note-18)  
&gt;  
&gt;The plague dealt massive damage to Athens two years into the Peloponnesian War, from which it never recovered. Their political strength had weakened and morale among their armies as well as the citizens had fallen significantly.

&lt;p&gt;Why was the naval power Athens so much more affected by the plague than the land power of Sparta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the oligarchic nature of Sparta and the other powers of the Eastern Mediterranean help them deal with the plague better than the comparatively democratic Athens? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aftermath[&lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plague_of_Athens&amp;amp;action=edit&amp;amp;section=6""&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt;]  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plague was an unforeseen event that resulted in one of the largest recorded loss of life in ancient Greece as well as a breakdown of Athenian society. The balance of power between citizens had changed due to many of the rich dying and their fortunes being inherited by remaining relatives of the lower class. According to Thucydides, those who had become ill and survived were the most sympathetic to others suffering: believing that they could no longer succumb to any illness, a number of survivors offered to assist with the remaining sick. The plague had also contributed to Athens&amp;#39; overall loss of power and ability to expand. Many of the remaining Athenians were found to be &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metic""&gt;metics&lt;/a&gt; who had forged their documentation or had bribed officials to hide their original status. A number of these people were reduced to slaves once they were caught. This resulted in stricter laws dictating who can become an Athenian citizen, reducing both their number of potential soldiers and amount of political power, but also a decline in treatment and rights for metics in Athens. &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Athens#cite_note-18""&gt;[18]&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plague dealt massive damage to Athens two years into the Peloponnesian War, from which it never recovered. Their political strength had weakened and morale among their armies as well as the citizens had fallen significantly. Athens would then go on to be defeated by Sparta and fall from being a major superpower in Ancient Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

It made me realize that reports about the Holocaust would have been high-profile enough that the Nazi government would have undoubtedly responded to them. I'd also be curious if there are cases of citizens hearing about the discovery of the death camps (perhaps by illegally listening to Allied radio?).

Searching this subreddit, I did find a relevant post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3nd4dy/how_did_the_nazis_try_to_hide_what_had_happened/cvshk4s/) by /u/commiespaceinvader. In discussing how the Nazis began covering up the Holocaust while the war was still going, it is said that they employed:

2. Political factors:
	American - less foreign intervention due to isolated geography

815,,AskHistorians,"Depending on who you ask, the mass migration of Germanic tribes into the area of the Roman Empire between the 4th and 6th century was the destabilizing factor leading to the collaps of the Western Roman Empire. While this view has been challenged (Rome had many other problems) and while the history between Germanic tribes and Rome is complicated  to say the least (from plundering babarians to foederati making the bulk of the Roman army in just a few years), I dont know how to imagine the German tribes showing up and settling somewhere. 

I know that numbers of troops/people from that time are always iffy, and largely depend on what message the author wants to send (looking at you caesar), but the ones I found were talking about tribes in the high 10 000, sometimes 100 000 and more for a single tribe, often excluding the women and children.

&amp;#x200B;

Did the Romans just suddenly have 100 000 Germans sitting inside their boarder from one day to another (to exaggerate a little bit)? Or was it more like ""you let one in and each day there are a few more"" kind of situation?

While this view has been challenged (Rome had many other problems) and while the history between Germanic tribes and Rome is complicated  to say the least (from plundering babarians to foederati making the bulk of the Roman army in just a few years), I dont know how to imagine the German tribes showing up and settling somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that numbers of troops/people from that time are always iffy, and largely depend on what message the author wants to send (looking at you caesar), but the ones I found were talking about tribes in the high 10 000, sometimes 100 000 and more for a single tribe, often excluding the women and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the Romans just suddenly have 100 000 Germans sitting inside their boarder from one day to another (to exaggerate a little bit)? Or was it more like &amp;quot;you let one in and each day there are a few more&amp;quot; kind of situation?&lt;/p&gt;

833,,AskHistorians,"I am about to finish my undergraduate in History and I just finished writing my senior paper last week about lynching as a spectacle in Jim Crow America and the role of newspapers in understanding lynching culture and attitudes among white Americans. When I gave my oral presentation to my professor, one thing that came up that I think I could have done better on, is the nature of American press during the Progressive Era. I used two books extensively as secondary resources, *Lynching and Spectacle* and  *Popular Justice: A History of Lynching in America*.

I believe I have a clear understanding of lynching culture, and I really got a lot from the books I read. For primary sources, I scoured ProQuest Journalism. I went through many articles describing mass lynchings (my focus was lynching spectacles, mass public events) but the newspapers rarely if ever tell you who the author of the article was and I'd like to understand the context of American journalism during that time period, especially when it comes to race relations. The book *Popular Justice* touches on class issues among the plantation class, poor whites, and the growing, urbanizing middle class, but unfortunately, I really couldn't find any articles touching on the incidents of lynching that I read about in the book. 

I'd like to fill in the gaps that I missed here.

Throughout the two millenia there would be multiple scholars and historians who would write essays discussing the contents and dating of the book.

Politically when the imperial librarian Liu Xin of the Han dynasty revived the book supposedly from the privation collection of Prince Liu De and incorporated into the classics there were accusations against Wang Mang of producing a forgery with the help of Liu Xin to legitimise his policies during the brief Xin dynasty interregnum between western han and eastern han dynasty.

During the medieval Song dynasty there was again a new discussion and criticism of the text by opponents of the prime minister Wang Anshi as using a fake inauthentic document as the basis of his new reforms which were unsuitable to contemporary times.

During the Qing dynasty the majority of Chinese historians would argue that the text could not have been earlier than the Han dynasty.To this day there are two camps within academia that either merit the origins of the text to either the patronage within the royal state of Zhou (period of the warring states) or that of a complete fabrication during the Han dynasty.

&gt;**David:** Well, the enclosures were, um, as the word sounds. They were enclosures of land, land which had previously been open to everyone to share. And so they could be used by the common people. They could plant potatoes there, for example, they could plant onions or they could plant trees and the trees would give firewood or they could use them as a place to to celebrate.

People had their own strips of land, but they sort of decided what crops everybody was going to grow more or less at the same time. And they would harvest at the same time and people would help one another out with the harvest. And there was a kind of communal thrust to work as well as a communal commitment to certain kinds of agriculture. Well, in the 18th century in particular, demand for food began to go way up because the population was rising. So grain prices in particular went way up. So if you could grow more grain, if you could have larger farms which were much more efficient to run, you could in fact make a great deal more money. So anyone with capital who already had a fair amount of land was trying to get more land. And the way they could do it was to get an act of parliament to say: if the people who own the majority of land in a parish wish to enclose it, it becomes legal. So, of course, the large landowners would have the majority of the land and several of them would get together and do a deal and get their act of parliament passed, which would mean that they could then break up all of these communal farming arrangements and they could take over the common land.

904,,AskHistorians,"A google search for ""Andrew Jackson + scar"" kicks off with this bit from [biography.com](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biography.com/.amp/us-president/andrew-jackson):

&gt; Captured by the British in 1781, **Jackson** was left with a permanent **scar** from his imprisonment after a British officer gashed his left hand and slashed his **face** with a sword because the young boy refused to polish the Redcoat's boots.

From wikipedia:

&gt;leaving him with *scars* on his left hand and *head*

One says *face*, the other says *head,* but most sources say he was struck on the face. To find the exact location on his face, I kept searching until I found [one article](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-two-andrew-jacksons/) that says *forehead*. Most sources include the fact that this scar was permanent, including *The Life of Andrew Jackson* by Marquis James, which also describes its color:

&gt; gash on his head left a white scar that Andrew Jackson carried through a long life.

With so much documentation on this facial scar I find it odd that we don't see it in any pictures of him. I'm not doubting that he was indeed scarred, though. Painters could've left it out for various reasons, but this would mean that everyone who painted him left it out knowingly or unknowingly and there are lots of paintings of him. Even his daguerreotypes don't appear to show it (admittedly, it may show it and I just haven't seen it. He was very old and wrinkled at the time which can make some scars hard to distinguish. But if this is the case and the legendary scar can be seen in his daguerrotypes, it has yet to be pointed out). It could be that it was prominent enough to be mentioned by contemporaries and historians but not enough to register in the minds of painters or on the silver sheets in daguerrotypes. It could also be that he was in fact struck on the head which would explain why there's no scar on his face.

This is all speculation though and maybe someone here can shed some light.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captured by the British in 1781, &lt;strong&gt;Jackson&lt;/strong&gt; was left with a permanent &lt;strong&gt;scar&lt;/strong&gt; from his imprisonment after a British officer gashed his left hand and slashed his &lt;strong&gt;face&lt;/strong&gt; with a sword because the young boy refused to polish the Redcoat&amp;#39;s boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;leaving him with &lt;em&gt;scars&lt;/em&gt; on his left hand and &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One says &lt;em&gt;face&lt;/em&gt;, the other says &lt;em&gt;head,&lt;/em&gt; but most sources say he was struck on the face. To find the exact location on his face, I kept searching until I found &lt;a href=""https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-two-andrew-jacksons/""&gt;one article&lt;/a&gt; that says &lt;em&gt;forehead&lt;/em&gt;. Most sources include the fact that this scar was permanent, including &lt;em&gt;The Life of Andrew Jackson&lt;/em&gt; by Marquis James, which also describes its color:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gash on his head left a white scar that Andrew Jackson carried through a long life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so much documentation on this facial scar I find it odd that we don&amp;#39;t see it in any pictures of him. I&amp;#39;m not doubting that he was indeed scarred, though. Painters could&amp;#39;ve left it out for various reasons, but this would mean that everyone who painted him left it out knowingly or unknowingly and there are lots of paintings of him. Even his daguerreotypes don&amp;#39;t appear to show it (admittedly, it may show it and I just haven&amp;#39;t seen it.
