51,,askscience,"Note on background: I am a student of math who has not studied physics. I know only the bits I have read on the web and some books.

I have seen acceleration defined as the second derivative of position w.r.t. time. Knowing this, acceleration is not necessarily continuous, but it at least takes all intermediate values on an interval.

However, I am not sure I like this definition and its consequences.

I have heard of the ""jerk,"" the third derivative of position w.r.t. time. If this derivative exists, then acceleration is differentiable, therefore continuous. However, I have no intuitive reason to believe ""jerk"" always exists.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I think we also have the following:

In an inertial frame of reference, for a body of constant mass m, we have (1/m)F = a. This feels like a more fundamental characterization of acceleration, but perhaps I am just pushing my curiosity onto forces.

If force is necessarily a continuous function of time, then acceleration is continuous as a consequence. The converse holds, too.

Are acceleration and force continuous functions of time? If so, how do we know? Do these results hold at all size scales at any speed?

Bonus points: Are there any good books about classical mechanics for someone of my background? I find myself in a strange place:
beginning undergraduate books are very frustrating because they obscure the truth behind physical notions and focus on menial calculations in extremely limited scenarios (""incline plane problems"", ""pendulum problems"", etc.).

Do you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: ""What would happen if..."", ""How will the future..."", ""If all the rules for 'X' were different..."", ""Why does my..."".

**Asking Questions:**

Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.

The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.

**Answering Questions:**

Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience).

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a question within these topics you weren&amp;#39;t sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical &lt;a href=""/r/AskScience""&gt;/r/AskScience&lt;/a&gt; post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: &amp;quot;What would happen if...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;How will the future...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;If all the rules for &amp;#39;X&amp;#39; were different...&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Why does my...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit &lt;a href=""/r/AskScienceDiscussion""&gt;/r/AskScienceDiscussion&lt;/a&gt; , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience""&gt;The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here&lt;/a&gt;.

For a bit of background, I'm a 3rd year grad student in physics but my program has not had a course offering in GR available since a year before I started. I have been trying to self teach basic GR, and have successfully derived the TOV equation in between all the normal grad student/TA duties.

But, there are three things I am still quite unclear about: the polytropic constant used for neutron star models (I've seen 0.25, 100, 5.38x10^9 and 1), the adiabatic index gamma (I've seen 4/3, 5/3, and 2), and central density (I've seen 1 used, but generally is unstated).

I'm just hoping to get clarity on these choices, in the hope of putting together a simple TOV numerical solver in Python that gives the 1.44 solar mass, approx 10 km result to see it with my own work, if possible.

US military forces were trained for conventional war and not for the guerrilla tactics they were facing in Vietnam. Let alone all political and strategic blunders.

Regardless, domestic pressure was building on the US administration to pull out of the war. North Vietnam was very aware of this, kept lines open with the USA, but always delayed real negotiations. Comprise equaled loss for the Vietnamese in the words of Henry Kissinger. He has a point.

The Tet-offensive is seen as a major psychological victory for North-Vietnam. However, the Vietcong with its South-Vietnamese fighters (no 'intruders') was heavily damaged due to this offensive. South Vietnamese fighters were forced out of their guerrilla hiding places to fight in the open. Exactly the kind of conventional warfare the US army was trained for. Strategically the Tet offensive was a US-South Vietnamese victory and from that point on North Vietnam had to rely on North Vietnamese regular troops. What effect would the war have had on North Vietnam if America would have placed a a major counter offensive in return and didn't push for negotiations right after this offensive.

It is worth noting that after the Tet offensive the North Vietnamese regime suddenly did accept negotiations. Sure, US elections were up and the North Vietnamese wanted to capitalize upon their psychological victory (and make sure also the next US administration was bound to their demands), but might they also have been aware that the continuation of the war might now actually start to turn the tables and give America (and South Vietnam) the upper hand? That any other negotiation would force them to make some very painful compromises?

So yes. The Tet offensive turned out to be a psychological victory. But if the Americans, from that point on, would actually have decided to drag on the war. If Johnson would have given the decision on what to do with the war to his successor (Nixon in this case). Would the Tet-offensive actually have turned out to be a major blunder?

I am still unsure about the time-frame and geographic focus, as it is depent on how much reliable resources I can find on disabled lawyers of a specific time/location. 

I was hoping to collected data on a variety of lawyers with disabilities, like how perceptions might have differed between older, experienced lawyers and young lawyers. Similarly, I realise that the legal profession was mainly limited to people who came from wealthier backgrounds. However, it would have been interesting to look at differences in perceptions of disabled lawyers from particularly well-connected families, versus those with less financial and political advantages. Another idea was to compare attitudes on mental versus physical disabilities, invisible and visible disabilities, and minor and serious disabilities. Lastly, I thought it would also be interesting to see if there are different attitudes toward disabled lawyers in people from big cities, versus rural areas.I have looked a bit into how lawyers were perceived in the American colonies in the 1700-1800s and haven’t been successful in finding anything about disabled lawyers. I suspect the problem is that those who could, would have hidden their disabilities. 

I am reading about the public shift on disabilities throughout the 1900s. I have familiarised myself with the advocacy work on behalf of disabled people during this time and the impact on the public’s view of disability, following the overwhelming numbers of veterans from the 2 world wars. It would be interesting to find accounts on disabled world war veterans who went on to have a career in law.

157,,AskHistorians,"In the official biography of Avicenna, al-Jūzjānī writes:

So you have to learn the fundamental science that's going to be applicable to whatever comes along next. And the same thing pretty much happened in medicine. So in the past century, again **for the first time, biology had something serious to tell to the practice of medicine**, so you had to understand biology if you want to be a doctor, and **technologies again will change**.

Well if you went to MIT in the 1960s, or now, it&amp;#39;s completely different. No matter what engineering field you&amp;#39;re in, you learn the same basic science and mathematics. And then maybe you learn a little bit about how to apply it. But that&amp;#39;s a very different approach. And it resulted maybe from the fact that really &lt;strong&gt;for the first time in history, the basic sciences, like physics, had something really to tell engineers.&lt;/strong&gt; And besides, &lt;strong&gt;technologies began to change very fast&lt;/strong&gt;, so not very much point in learning the technologies of today if it&amp;#39;s going to be different 10 years from now. So you have to learn the fundamental science that&amp;#39;s going to be applicable to whatever comes along next. And the same thing pretty much happened in medicine. So in the past century, again &lt;strong&gt;for the first time, biology had something serious to tell to the practice of medicine&lt;/strong&gt;, so you had to understand biology if you want to be a doctor, and &lt;strong&gt;technologies again will change&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, I think that&amp;#39;s the kind of transition from something like an art, that you learn how to practice—an analog would be trying to match some data that you don&amp;#39;t understand, in some fashion, maybe building something that will work—to science, what happened in the modern period, roughly Galilean science.&lt;/p&gt;

229,,AskHistorians,"I have recently stumbled across a mini-documentary from an amateur historian called ""The Turkish Century"" going over a brief history of Turkey starting from the Bronze Age to the late 20th century.

The part that really interested me was he started going over the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the father of the modern nation of Turkey. Specifically his affiliation but also disagreements with the Young Turks, who tried to reform the late Ottoman Empire before and during WWI.

In the video, he discusses the complete ineptitude of the Young Turks and their ""pro-German/Prussian"" leanings of government and politics. The blunders of the Pasha brothers, and failed campaigns into Russia during WWI.  He also discussed Ataturks incredibly progressive writings, political views, liberal legislation, and what most people would now today read as incredibly ""pro-western"" and ""euro-centric"" viewpoints. Including giving women the right to vote before the United States, separating religion from the state, working to have an industry mimicking western civilizations, and anti-imperialist viewpoints.

Here are my questions:

* Was Ataturk truly that much of a visionary?
* Was he really that pro-western?
* Were the Young Turks and the Pasha brother truly that incompetent as leaders?
