    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model suffers in terms of precision, correctly predicitng the positive class as the posivite class. More work needs to be done on:\n",
    "- XGBoost being non-parametric plus the features i engineered are not readable to the lay person\n",
    "- Feature engineering, a tweet after closing could impact the following day's one.\n",
    "- Collection of more data on the positive class, or even change the parameters of a positive class\n",
    "- Try additional an ensemble of machine learning models\n",
    "- Feed the whole feature set into the neural network\n",
    "- More work can be done on the LSTM model,from optimisation of hyperparameters to including a timeseries generator\n",
    "- Additional work can be further done on the topic modelling\n",

    "## Recommendation to the US market team at the bank\n",
    "- On days of positive class, Trump tends to tweet more on average\n",
    "- The model is able to accurately predict when his tweets will not move the market"
